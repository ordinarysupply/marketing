Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

Iâ€™m Ben. A design strategist from Toronto, Canada. Iâ€™m the co-founder and CMO of a company called Kotn, where I focus on creating and scaling a great customer experience. I made this site to share: media and tools that shape my work, my professional history, and occasionally my own thoughts.
